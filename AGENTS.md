# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This repository contains an engineering proposal for "Decision Records with AI Assistance" - a convention for preserving the "why" behind decisions as versioned artifacts alongside code.

**This is a documentation repository, not a software project.** There is no code to build, test, or lint.

## Key Document

The entire proposal is in `README.md`. It covers:
- Directory structure for decision artifacts (`ai_docs/`)
- Artifact types: Plans, Research (including ADRs), Handoffs
- Document schema with required frontmatter fields
- Quality bar and security policies
- Workflow for committing docs with code
- Lifecycle management and maintenance

## Working on This Repository

- All changes are to Markdown documentation
- The proposal follows standard Markdown formatting
- Cross-reference sections within README.md when making edits
- Preserve the structured format (frontmatter examples, tables, code blocks)
